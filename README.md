Low level programming projects...

*********First Project: Snake******

For the file Snake.asm to work properly you need to have the following minimum hardware:
1. protoboard

2. Eight LEDs

3. An 11.0592 MHz Crystal.

4. an 89C52 ATMEL Microcontroller.

I will not cover the circuit part of this project because that's something you need to check on the lab ðŸ˜‰

******Second Project: C language snippets *********************

The following are snippets in C. They might come handy:

simpleAdding.c
getSubString.c
